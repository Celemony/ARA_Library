# ARA Audio Random Access: Implementation Library

The ARA_Library Git repository contains an extensive set of C++ classes and utility functions to ease
ARA development. It is intended to be used as a submodule when building ARA-enabled products.

Developers should download the [full ARA_SDK repository](https://github.com/Celemony/ARA_SDK)
which includes this repository along with the core ARA API specification, full documentation and
detailed example code.

Any public release of ARA-enabled software should be based on a tagged public release of the ARA API.
If temporarily using HEAD to study current work-in-progress, keep in mind that in order to achieve a
concise long-term change history, any changes since the last tagged release may eventually be rebased.
