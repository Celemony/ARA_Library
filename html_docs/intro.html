<h1><a class="anchor" id="sec_Welcome"></a>
Welcome</h1>
<p>First of all, thank you for your interest in the ARA Audio Random Access API. <br>                               Celemony Software GmbH and its ARA partners put a lot of effort into establishing ARA as a mature, reliable platform. By publishing this Software Development Kit (SDK) free of any licensing fees under the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0 License</a>, Celemony invites more interested audio developers to join the ARA community. <br>                              </p>
<p>Interacting with an API as complex as ARA requires careful execution by all involved parties in order to minimize bugs and incompatibilities and provide a great user experience across all the different host/plug-in combinations. Therefore, all ARA developers are requested to please follow these guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Study the API and its accompanying documentation carefully before planning your adoption of ARA.</li>
<li>If in doubt about any detail of the API, please get in touch with us via <a href="#" onclick="location.href='mai'+'lto:'+'ara'+'@c'+'ele'+'mo'+'ny.'+'co'+'m'; return false;">ara@c<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>elem<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>ony.c<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>om</a>.</li>
<li>Do not modify the API in any way, and stick to official API releases for your public releases.</li>
<li>Test carefully with a wide range of hosts/plug-ins respectively, both in terms of the API contract and in terms of product design/user experience.</li>
<li>If you experience bugs in the SDK or with a particular ARA-enabled product, notify Celemony or the product vendor respectively.</li>
<li>If a bug is reported for your product, try fixing it within a reasonable time frame.</li>
<li>Communication between ARA partners should be concise, friendly and respectful as laid out for in example in the <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html">Apache Code of Conduct</a>. <br>                              </li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that ARA Audio Random Access is a registered trademark of Celemony Software GmbH. Permission to use this trademark for your product (website, boxes, etc.) may be granted free of charges after Celemony or a selected ARA development partner on behalf of Celemony has tested your implementation with respect to the above guidelines. <br>                               The purpose of this process is to leverage the valuable experience of long-time ARA developers to catch potential bugs and incompatibilities before they are released, considerably easing the maintenance of ARA-enabled products and the entire ARA platform in the long run. <br>                              </p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md0"></a>
About ARA</h1>
<p>ARA Audio Random Access is an extension for established plug-in standard APIs such as <a href="https://github.com/steinbergmedia/vst3sdk"><code>VST3</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/audiotoolbox"><code>Audio Units</code></a> to allow for a much-improved DAW integration of plug-ins like Celemony's Melodyne which are conceptually closer to a sample editor than to a conventional realtime audio processor. ARA does not try to replace the established plug-in standards, but rather augments them with additional features that are not present in the current versions of these standards, yet are crucial for a great user experience when using plug-ins like Melodyne. <br>                              </p>
<p>As the name suggests, ARA's primary focus is enabling plug-ins to read audio from the host independently of the render callbacks. It needs to provide some information about the arrangement of the audio inside the host to accomplish this task. <br>                               On top of the actual audio access, ARA allows to exchange descriptions of the content of an actual audio signal, for example in terms of notes that were played when recording the signal. Advanced plug-ins like Melodyne may be capable of deriving this information by analyzing the waveform of the signal, enabling the host to build features on top of this description exchange that were simply impossible to accomplish before. <br>                               A third major feature of ARA is allowing plug-ins to be used as a time-stretching engine for the host. <br>                              </p>
<p>The regular ARA workflow starts by the host providing random access to the audio material that it wants to be processed through an ARA capable plug-in. It specifies what parts of the audio material are to be played at what point in time. It also provides a description of the musical context such as tempo or harmonic structure in which the material will be played back. <br>                               The plug-in then performs an in-depth analysis of the material. Its graphical user interface, which typically resembles some sort of advanced "sample editor", will allow for adjusting the results of the analysis as the user sees fit. <br>                               Based on the (potentially edited) analysis results, the plug-in can then adjust the audio content to the musical context when rendering it. This can include both time-stretching and pitch-shifting of parts of the material as needed to create musically meaningful results. <br>                               The user can also interact further and apply whatever creative editing is desired and enabled by the plug-in - in the case of Melodyne editor that would include freely rearranging any notes contained in the audio. <br>                               Further, the results of the analysis and of the creative editing are provided to the host and it can use this information e.g. to enrich its graphical representation of the material or to feed the description to a synthesizer that duplicates the musical content of the original audio (but creates a different sound). <br>                              </p>
<p>Opposed to established offline processing APIs such as <code>AudioSuite</code> or <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/audiounit/audio_unit_properties/1534054-offline_audio_unit_properties"><code>Offline Audio Units</code></a>, he rendering part of ARA remains realtime capable, only the audio access and the analysis are done "offline" on non-realtime threads. <br>                              </p>
<p>The flexibility of the ARA API allows for a large set of features to be implemented in very different host scenarios. On the <a href="https://www.celemony.com/ara">ARA home page</a> you will find a movie that demonstrates ARA in action, illustrating some of the workflows possible. <br>                               Also, to gain a deeper understanding of plug-ins like Melodyne that allow editing on per-note-level and their potential capabilities you can check the Melodyne <a href="https://helpcenter.celemony.com/M5/doc/melodyneStudio5/en/M5tour_StudioOneARA_InsertVorbereitungen3?env=studioOne">online manual</a>, which also contains many more videos. <br>                              </p>
<p>ARA has been developed by <a href="https://www.celemony.com">Celemony</a> in collaboration with <a href="https://www.presonus.com">PreSonus</a>. <br>                              </p>
